# macOS changelog

Changes to the aniCe Mac app. Repository-wide changes are recorded in the [root changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Shared manual Bonjour/TCP admission, encrypted LAN connection checks, same-peer reservations and sandbox network declarations.

- Shared automatic nearby admission with five-failure cooldown, persisted allowed-phone policy, paused Disconnect and sleep/wake restoration.
- Coordinated encrypted renewal requests before session lifetime or record limits.

- Session control negotiation and encrypted keepalive replies, sharing existing record limits, trust validation and bounded transport queues.
- Shared CBOR conformance fixtures and hosted tests for control ordering, timeouts, legacy peers, submission failure and suspended-send cancellation.
- Allow connections and session controls shared by window and companion, native AES-GCM record actor, admission failure/window limits, advertising-independent established traffic and sleep/Quit cleanup.
- Actor-isolated EDHOC method 0 / suite 5 handshake engine, pinned CCS credentials, strict CBOR/signature codecs, and shared conformance tests.
- Pairing: QR and six-digit code invitations with PAKE bootstrap, stable three-characteristic GATT peripheral adapter, mutual approval, atomic peer trust store, dedicated pairing and trusted-devices panels.
- Explicit bounded BLE peripheral discovery shared by window and companion, read-only rotating nonce payload, sandbox/usage configuration, and sleep/Quit cleanup.
- Persistent P-256 identity with immutable Keychain generations, atomic reset/recovery, typed errors, and signing snapshots.
- Native SwiftUI application with resizable single-instance window, menu-bar companion, and system light/dark appearance using the shared palette.

### Changed

- Replace repeating BLE/LAN maintenance timers with revision-guarded deadline tasks; separate visible admission countdowns from security work.
- Match service-level trust revocation to the owning journal and retire both transports on identity reset/recovery.

- Update macOS code structure tree, test inventory, and manual LAN documentation in README.
- Document source/configuration responsibilities and session invariants inline: trust revalidation, nonce ownership, readiness, bounded fragmentation, submission semantics and best-effort secret cleanup.
- Load existing public identity state without a startup signing challenge; retain creation/reset checks and verification of requested signatures.
- Merge secured state and authenticated-device feedback into one status line in window and companion.

### Fixed

- LAN TCP enables bounded native keepalives and retransmission timeout so an unreachable phone is detected before the authenticated idle limit.

- Keep delayed pairing cleanup from replacing a newer pairing or discovery radio owner with automatic session admission.
- Allow fresh session admission on retained Core Bluetooth indication subscriptions during an explicit window while preserving exclusive admission.
- Show pairing actions on an unpaired Mac; hide unavailable connection controls in window and companion while retaining active-operation controls.
- Declare finite session-task ownership explicitly while retaining weak transport/channel callbacks, resolving Swift nested-capture diagnostics.
- Retain session termination reason and distinguish idle/lifetime limits, authenticated peer closure and trust failure.
- Show pairing completion and saved trust without placeholder text.
- Send encrypted cancellation on pairing Decline with bounded transport draining before invitation cleanup.

The foundation uses development version `0.0.0` (build `1`) and a provisional macOS 14 minimum.
